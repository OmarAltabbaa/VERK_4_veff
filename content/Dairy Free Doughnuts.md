__Inheld__

+ ¼ cup vegan margarine (50 g)
+ ½ cup soy milk (120 mL)
+ 2 tablespoons sunflower oil, plus 1 litre (4 cups) extra for frying
+ 2 cups plain flour (250 g)
+ ½ cup caster sugar (100 g)
+ 1 teaspoon baking powder
+ ½ teaspoon salt


__aðferð__

1. Gently melt the butter over a low-medium heat. Add milk and 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil and mix together. Once combined, take     off the heat and set aside.

2. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, half of the sugar, baking powder and salt with a fork. Make a well in the centre.

3. Pour the butter mixture into the well. Combine gradually until a thick dough forms.

4. Using your hands, roll dough into little flat balls and with your thumb, press a hole in the centre of each doughnut. (You may       need to flour your hands for this part to avoid getting sticky!)

5. Heat up the litre of oil in a pan. To know when it's hot enough, fry a little bit of bread in the oil. If it goes brown and          floats to the top, in 45-50 seconds the oil will be ready!

6. Gently lay the doughnuts into the oil using a spatula. Fry for about 3-5 minutes on each side, until golden brown.

7. Transfer the doughnuts onto some tissue paper to soak up any excess oil. Then roll into a bowl of the remaining sugar.
